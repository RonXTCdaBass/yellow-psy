# yellow-psy
"Psy" is a dark theme for "datenstrom-yellow" by RonXTCdaBass.

all themes for "Yellow" iÂ´ve seen, are toooo bright for me.
so iÂ´ve made this design.

nothing special, just a few colors that are easier on my :eyes: eyes at night ;)


my first upload for the "datenstrom-yellow" cms
[visit](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow) for more infoÂ´s and to download your Yellow. 

the theme need the [breadcrumb](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-breadcrumb) extension.

simply copied and pasted the howto ^^

## How to install an extension

[Download ZIP file](https://github.com/RonXTCdaBass/yellow-psy/archive/main.zip) 

and copy it into your `system/extensions` folder. [Learn more about extensions](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-update).


you can simply delete the :key: for editing by using a texteditor...

search in file "psy-footer.html" line 4   

`<a href="edit/"><small>&#128273;</small></a>`   

delete it, save the file and ðŸŽ‰ ready...

---

to change the editor design too, into my used style, 

1. make a backup of your YOUR-PATH-TO-YELLOW\system\extensions\edit.css

2. download 
[psy-edit.css.txt](https://github.com/RonXTCdaBass/yellow-psy/files/13303822/psy-edit.css.txt) -> rename it to edit.css ->

3. upload and overwrite the existing file in the "extensions" folder.
